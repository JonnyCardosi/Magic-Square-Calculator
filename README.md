# Magic-Square-Calculator
Java program that can calculate all solutions to a normal NxN magic square or verify if a given matrix is a solution to its corresponding NxN normal magic square. The Eclipse IDE 
was used to facilitate this program's creation.

**- Please note that when calculating all solutions for normal magic squares, 1x1 to 4x4 magic squares will be relatively fast to run because they only need to sift through a few hundred distinct possible solutions, whereas anything of dimension 5x5 and above will be sifting through possible solutions on the order of hundreds of millions or way more, so be mindful of what your computer can handle.**
