# Magic-Square-Calculator
Java program that can calculate all solutions to a normal NxN magic square or verify if a given matrix is a solution to its corresponding NxN normal magic square. Eclipse IDE 
was used to facilitate this program's creation. Input and output are provided or given respectively via the default terminal or IDE terminal, and basic input error-checks are included in the program. 

**Please note that when calculating all solutions for normal magic squares, 1x1 through 4x4 magic squares are relatively fast to run due to their possible distinct solutions only being in the hundreds, whereby anything of dimension 5x5 and above will have possible solutions on the order of hundreds of millions or way more, so be mindful of what your computer can handle**
